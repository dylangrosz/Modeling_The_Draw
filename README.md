# Modeling The Stanford Housing Draw
## Process Simple Query (processQuery.py)
A simple query will allow a student to input a single housing draw scenario so they can see what chance they have to get certain housing given their gender, tier number, desired residence/room type, and amount of people in applicant group.

Simply, this functionality will answer the following query with a probability: <br>
I am a *[gender]* applying as *[applyType]*. If I apply for a *[roomType]* in *[resName]* using tier *[tierNum]*, what are my chances of getting in?
## Clean Housing Data (cleanHousingData.py)
Take raw housing data from *[Stanford R&DE Historical Draw Numbers](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/historical-draw-statistics)* and clean and standardize the data.
